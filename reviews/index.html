        Send me your gadgets!
    </h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy technology and I love nothing more than receiving new gadgets. If I'm not buying a new toy to play with, I'm reading about the latest <em>thing</em> somewhere.

        I've had the opportunity to review some great gadgets, and I'm always looking forward to reviewing the newest and best. If you'd like me to write a review, <a href="https://omgmog.net/#contact">get in touch</a>.
