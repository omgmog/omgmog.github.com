title: Imgur Url Changer and pics/funny comment link subreddit remover aka reddit link stuff
---

I know, it sure is a catchy name!

This is just a modification of my previous "Imgur to Filmot url changer" userscript for reddit.com

<!-- more -->

Again this is to facilitate getting around the filters at work, it removes `/r/pics` and `/r/funny` from their respective comment urls, so they don't get caught by the filters.

So for example

[http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test\_post\_please\_ignore/](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/)

becomes

[http://www.reddit.com/comments/92dd8/test\_post\_please\_ignore/](http://www.reddit.com/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/)
