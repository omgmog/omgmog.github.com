title: Reddit imgur to filmot url changer
---

Browsing Reddit while at work probably isn't the best thing to do if trying to be productive, but sometimes it's necessary to unwind periodically.

Inside our intranet at work imgur is blocked, so browsing Reddit isn't as enjoyable as it could be.. until now!

<!-- more -->

I whipped up a simple userscript to change all imgur.com urls into filmot.com (an imgur mirror, that isn't blocked) so I can now browse Reddit hassle-free!

You can grab the userscript from userscripts.org [here](http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/104691)
