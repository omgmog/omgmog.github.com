title: Using a Chromebook in 2020
comments_issue: 105

I've just got hold of a [Lenovo Ideapad Duet 2-in-1 Chromebook/tablet](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/lenovo/student-chromebooks/Lenovo-CT-X636/p/ZZICZCTCT1X). ChromeOS seems to have come quite a long way since I last used the HP Chromebook 11 back in 2013. 

With native support for Android apps and a full Debian linux that seemlessly integrates with the rest of the OS -- maybe we're finally at a point where a Chromebook could be a device capable of doing _real work_!

So far I've installed VS Code, GIMP, Firefox and a bunch of terminal-based tools/apps (Git, Jekyll, etc,) I'm writing this post from that very environment.

The Lenovo Ideapad Duet comes with a detachable full keyboard -- many reviews will complain about the narrow key layout on the right-hand side of the keyboard -- but it's very usable, I can work on my muscle memory to avoid hitting _0_ instead of _-_ repeatedly.

This device might seem redundant in my already full arsenal of an iPad, Macbook 13" and OnePlus 7 Pro, but it fits in quite nicely. It feels more like a content creation tool than the iPad and it integrates with my Google account and connects seemlessly with the OnePlus 7 Pro for connectivity and smart unlocking.

I might do a full device review in the coming days/weeks if I find myself with a chunk of time to fill.
