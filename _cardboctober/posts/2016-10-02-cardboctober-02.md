For today's Cardboctober hack I'm doing some basic look interaction.

As you look at each ghost in the circle surrounding you the ghost will cover their eyes.

This is really basic, and uses Three's built-in `THREE.Raycaster`. You can imagine a raycaster as a laser beam shining from your eye to the point that you're looking at.

In this hack I'm grabbing the first object that the raycaster hits and then changing the material.
