Today we're looking at HTML5 video -- well not in the traditional sense. We're looking at using the `<video>` element to create a texture and then applying it to an object in our 3D scene.

I'm using the trailer for the CC-Licensed "[Big Buck Bunny](https://peach.blender.org/)" movie for my video.

## Creating a little cinema

Before we get on to actually using a video, we need somewhere suitable to play it. So let's build a cinema.

Abstractly a cinema is a bunch of seats facing a screen. So let's work with that. First the chairs layout.

A chair is made of a number of `BoxGeometry`'s grouped inside an `Object3D`:

```javascript
var chairObject = new THREE.Object3D();
var chairBase = core.build(
  'BoxGeometry'
  // etc...
);
var chairBack = core.build(
  'BoxGeometry'
  // etc...
);

chairObject.add(chairBase);
chairObject.add(chairBack);
// etc.
```

I've not given the full exhaustive source for creating a chair there, but you can see how I do it in full in [10/demo.js#L40-L97](https://github.com/cardboctober/max/blob/master/10/demo.js#L40-L97).

{% include figure.html src="2016-10/10/chair.png" %}{:.massive.center}


We can define the layout of the chairs as a multidimenstional array, with `0` meaning no chair and `1` meaning a chair:

```javascript
var chairArrangement = [
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
];
```

And then we can loop through this array and position each chair model in the scene:

```javascript
var height = 0;
var metrics = {
  width: 6,
  height: 6,
  depth: 8,
};
var chairs = [];
var xOffset = (metrics.width * chairArrangement[0].length) / 2;
chairArrangement.forEach(function(row, i) { // for each row
  var _row = [];
  row.forEach(function(col, j) { // for each col
    if (col == 1) {
      // create a clone of our chair
      var chair = chairObject.clone();
      // position the chair
      chair.position.x = (j * metrics.width) - xOffset;
      chair.position.y = height * (0.3 * metrics.height);
      chair.position.z = i * metrics.depth;

      // add the chair to the scene
      scene.add(chair);
      _row[j] = chair;
    }
  });
  chairs.push(_row);
  height++;
});
```

{% include figure.html src="2016-10/10/chairs.png" %}{:.massive.center}

Now that we've made a bunch of chairs, wouldn't it be cool to randomly position the camera in one on each load? It's quite simple to do, just take the `chair.position` and use it to set the `camera.position` (with some minor tweaking)

```javascript
var randomIndex = function (array) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
};
var randomSeat = function () {
  var indexR = randomIndex(chairArrangement);
  var indexC = randomIndex(chairArrangement[indexR]);

  // Make sure we've got a chair (1) not an empty space (0)
  while (chairArrangement[indexR][indexC] == 0) {
    indexC = randomIndex(chairArrangement[indexR]);
  }
  return {
    row: indexR,
    col: indexC
  };
};

var gotochair = function (seat) {
  var targetChair = chairs[seat.row][seat.col];
  camera.position.set(
    targetChair.position.x,
    targetChair.position.y + 4,
    targetChair.position.z
  );
  camera.lookAt(
    new T.Vector3(
      screen.position.x,
      screen.position.y,
      screen.position.z
    )
  );
};

gotochair(randomSeat());
```

## The screen

For the screen we just have a massive `BoxGeometry` again, positioned in front of the rows of chairs. We'll texture this using the video later on, but for an initial state it's a good place to put some instructions.

```javascript

var videotexture = textureLoader.load('video.png');
var screen = core.build(
  'BoxGeometry', [120, 60, 0],
  'MeshLambertMaterial', [{
    color: 0xffffff,
    map: videotexture,
    overdraw: 0.5
  }]
);
screen.position.set(0, 20, -50);
scene.add(screen);
```

{% include figure.html src="2016-10/10/screen.png" %}{:.massive.center}


And now that we have a screen, we can load a video. For this we're going to create a `video` element, with a number of `source` element children that specify the various formats to use.

```javascript
// Create a video element
var video = document.createElement('video');
  video.poster = 'video.png';
// Add the sources...
// webm
var videoSource = document.createElement('source');
videoSource.src = 'video.webm';
videoSource.type = 'video/webm';
video.appendChild(videoSource);
// ogg
videoSource = document.createElement('source');
videoSource.src = 'video.ogv';
videoSource.type = 'video/ogg';
video.appendChild(videoSource);
// mp4
videoSource = document.createElement('source');
videoSource.src = 'video.mp4';
videoSource.type = 'video/mp4';
video.appendChild(videoSource);
```

Next we'll create a 2d `canvas` on which we'll later load the video frames:

```javascript
// Make your video canvas
var videocanvas = document.createElement('canvas');
var videocanvasctx = videocanvas.getContext('2d');

// Set its size (multiples of 8!)
var vidw = 1024;
var vidh = 512;

videocanvas.width = vidw;
videocanvas.height = vidh;

videocanvasctx.fillStyle = "#222222";
videocanvasctx.fillRect(0,0,vidw,vidh);
```

Then when the video is playing, update the `canvas` in our render loop so that it gets the current frame of the video:

```javascript
var update = function () {
  if ( video.readyState === video.HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA ){
    //draw video to canvas starting from upper left corner
    videocanvasctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0);
    //tell texture object it needs to be updated
    videotexture.needsUpdate = true;
  }
  // Other bits in our loop...
};
```

To trigger the `video.load()` and `video.play()` and assign the texture to our `screen`, we're using `vreticle.js` to provide an `ongazelong` event.

```javascript
var playing = false;
screen.ongazelong = function () {
  if (!playing) {
    videotexture = new THREE.Texture(videocanvas);
    videotexture.wrapS = videotexture.wrapT = T.RepeatWrapping;
    videotexture.repeat.x = 1;
    videotexture.repeat.y = 1;
    videotexture.offset.x = -.15;
    videotexture.offset.y = .1;
    screen.material.map = videotexture;
    video.load();
    video.play();
    reticle.remove_collider(screen);
  }
};
reticle.add_collider(screen);
```

## Issues on mobile

Initially I had tried to simply `video.load()` and `video.play()` the video when the scene loaded. This worked fine on Chrome desktop, but not on Chrome mobile. After a lot of fiddling and Googling I found that this is because Chrome limits automatically triggering video playback with JavaScript. For example you don't want a website you're viewing on your phone to automatically load and play a massive video file over your data connection.

That's fair enough, so to get around this we have to trigger the `video.load()` and `video.play()` from within a `click`/`touchstart` event.

Ammending our earlier `screen.ongazelong` we can just add a check to see if we're on mobile, and then `addEventListener` to listen for a `click` and trigger `video.load()` and `video.play()`. You can see the updated `screen.ongazelong` even in [demo.js#L195-L229](https://github.com/cardboctober/max/blob/master/10/demo.js#L195-L229)

By this point the video is playing nicely (not so performantly on mobile though!) but I wanted to add another feature. When you're sat in a cinema or even when you're watching a TV, the light from the screen is usually cast around the room. So let's do that in our scene.

I'm using a library called [Color Thief](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/) to extract the four dominant colors in each frame of the video, and then using these to color four `THREE.PointLight`'s that I've positioned around the screen.

First setup the lights:

```javascript
var lightsobj = [
  [0xffffff, -25, 30, -35],
  [0xffffff, 25, 30, -35],
  [0xffffff, -25, 0, -35],
  [0xffffff, 25, 0, -35]
];
var lights = [];
lightsobj.forEach(function (lobj, i) {
  var _light = new T.PointLight(lobj[0], .5, 0, 1);
  _light.position.set(lobj[1], lobj[2], lobj[3]);
  lights.push(_light);
  scene.add(_light);
});
```

And then later on in the render loop, each time we get a new frame we can grab the dominant colors and recolor the lights:

```javascript
var colorThief = new ColorThief();

var update = function () {
  // Other video frame stuff...

  var domcolors = colorThief.getPalette(videocanvas, lightsobj.length);
  domcolors.forEach(function (color, i) {
    var colorrgb = core.template("rgb({r}, {g}, {b})",{
      r:color[0],
      g:color[1],
      b:color[2],
    });
    var tcolor = new THREE.Color(colorrgb);
    lights[i].color = tcolor;
  });

  // Other render loop stuff
}
```

And we're done. You might want to mess with the intensity of the lights, or play with having more lights/dominant color samples.

## A note about the delay in publishing this write-up

So this write-up (though dated 10/10/16) was actually published on 11/10/16. I decided to refactor most of my `core.js` library while working on day 10's hack and it took a little longer than I had planned.
