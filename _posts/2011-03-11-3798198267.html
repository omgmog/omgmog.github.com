title: Javascript function to group repeated values of an array with totals
---

<p>Something that took a little while to pull of well while working on the <a href="http://blog.omgmog.net/post/3707266857" target="_blank">JS challenge this week</a>, thought I&#8217;d throw it up here as it has its uses practically for grouping like array values with totals:</p>

<p>This is outputting to the console log for the sake of testing it, but the kind of output you&#8217;d expect to see is a multidimensional array.</p>

<p>Should have the rest of my solution to the challenge up tomorrow, with a nice post explaining the tough time<a href="http://blog.tmayr.com" target="_blank"> Tomas</a> and I have had fighting our urge to reveal code/brainstorm together.</p>
