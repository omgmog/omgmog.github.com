<p>Over the weekend I relaunched <a target="_blank" href="http://dingoonity.org">Dingoonity.org</a>. I launched the site back in November 2009, a bit of a rush job as far as the design of the boards was concerned &#8212; it coincided with me getting a full-time web design job at RS Components, so while giving the paid job my 100%, Dingoonity&#8217;s design got neglected.</p>

<p>Since then I have tried to find time to finish up the design, and early last year I got pretty close to releasing a new design based on the existing Simple Machines Forum 1.1.x software, but I never found it a particularly nice experience to work around the muddy tables of the board pages, and so never finished the design.</p>

<p>Cut to earlier this month, after neglecting the community more than I care to admit, I was chatting with one of the co-founders and it occurred to me that even though I&#8217;m neglecting and not nurturing the website, the community continues to thrive.</p>

<p>Dingoonity has 2750 members who have written 26600 posts in 2900 topics. Not bad for a niche community about a <a title="Dingoo A320" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingoo">Chinese portable console</a> that is able to play hundreds of retro console games, and hundreds of new homebrew games.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Amidst some future plans for the site, I decided I would finally get around to finishing up the design of the site, and so I created a development server with a copy of the database from the live site, and set about trying out some things. The site now runs on Simple Machines Forum 2.0 RC4 &#8212; so it has with that a whole load of improvements.</p>

<p>The main focus of the new design was to make the home/news page more connected to the boards, and I&#8217;ve done that by having a fixed persistant header section with links to all major areas of the site (profile/messages/help/rules/search/admin/etc.), as well as throwing in a rather nice modal login box that I wrote using jQuery.</p>

<p>The relaunch went pretty smoothly, though initially I had some problems with transferring packages/modifications from my development server over to the live site, but during the early hours of last night and much of today I&#8217;ve successfully squashed most of the major issues.</p>

<p>There are some features that I was unable to bring over from the old SMF install, but I hope to be able to add these as soon as their packages have been updated/fixed to work correctly.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in seeing the difference of the board from before, to now, here are a couple of full-page screenshots comparing the old and new:</p>
