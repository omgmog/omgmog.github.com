Something that took a little while to pull of well while working on the [JS challenge this week]({% post_url 2011-03-07-3707266857 %}), thought I'd throw it up here as it has its uses practically for grouping like array values with totals:

<!-- more -->

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var testdata = ['a','a','a','b','b','c','c','c','c','d','d','d','e'];
var i=0, x, count, item;
while(i &lt; testdata.length){
    count = 1;
    item = testdata[i];
    x = i+1;

    while(x &lt; testdata.length &amp;&amp; (x=testdata.indexOf(item,x))!=-1){
        count+=1;
        testdata.splice(x,1);
    }
    testdata[i] = new Array(testdata[i],count);
    ++i;
}
console.log(testdata);
{% endhighlight %}

This is outputting to the console log for the sake of testing it, but the kind of output you'd expect to see is a multidimensional array.

Should have the rest of my solution to the challenge up tomorrow, with a nice post explaining the tough time [Tomas](http://tmayr.comv) and I have had fighting our urge to reveal code/brainstorm together.
