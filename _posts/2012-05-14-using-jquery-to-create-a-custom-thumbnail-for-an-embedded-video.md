Recently [Jenny](http://twitter.com/jennybroomfield) asked me for a way to embed a YouTube video with a custom thumbnail that would play the video when clicked.

I'm aware that YouTube allows [Partners](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=1100428) to use a custom thumbnail for their videos, but standard users are restricted to a selection of random frames from their uploaded video. If you want your YouTube embed to look nice on your site, but are not a Partner, this isn't ideal.

I Googled around to look for a solution, but most solutions involve adding extra frames to the video at specific intervals, and trimming videos using YouTube once they've been uploaded. Again, not ideal.

I decided to approach this from a more technical angle then, and so I came up with the following jQuery snippet
<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/2690184">https://gist.github.com/2690184</a></div>

This needs to be used with the following `HTML` structure:
<div class="gist"><a href="https://gist.github.com/2690199">https://gist.github.com/2690199</a></div>

And there you have it, a custom thumbnail for a YouTube embedded video.
