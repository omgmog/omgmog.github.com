Recently [Jenny](http://jennybroomfield.co.uk) asked me for a way to embed a YouTube video with a custom thumbnail that would play the video when clicked.

<!-- more -->

I'm aware that YouTube allows [Partners](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=1100428) to use a custom thumbnail for their videos, but standard users are restricted to a selection of random frames from their uploaded video. If you want your YouTube embed to look nice on your site, but are not a Partner, this isn't ideal.

I Googled around to look for a solution, but most solutions involve adding extra frames to the video at specific intervals, and trimming videos using YouTube once they've been uploaded. Again, not ideal.

I decided to approach this from a more technical angle then, and so I came up with the following `jQuery` snippet

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
$(function () {
    $('.ytembed:not(.processed)').each(function () {
        var $embed = $(this),
            $img = $embed.find('img'),
            $anchor = $embed.find('a'),
            width = $img.width(),
            height = $img.height(),
            url = $anchor.attr('href'),
            $iframe = $('<iframe />', {
                'src': url,
                'width': width,
                'height': height,
                'frameborder': 0
            });

        $anchor.click(function (e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            $embed.html($iframe);
        });
    });
});
{% endhighlight %}

This needs to be used with the following `HTML` structure:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!-- you need a div with the class 'ytembed' -->
<div class="ytembed">
    <!-- put a link with the url of your video embed -->
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">
        <!-- and an image with the width/height specified -->
        <img
            width="560"
            height="315"
            src="/path/to/custom_thumbnail.jpg"
            alt="Click to play"
        />
    </a>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

And there you have it, a custom thumbnail for a YouTube embedded video.
