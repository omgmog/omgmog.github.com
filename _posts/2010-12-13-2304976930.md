I'm probably stating something very obvious to everybody, but this is something that caused me a couple of hours of confusion.

When creating a new slightly-fancier page to be displayed on [omgmog.net](http://omgmog.net)Â I had a problem in that after a certain amount of time the browser would become unresponsive (or in Google Chrome the page would die &mdash; but I love how Google Chrome handles this).

The problem I soon realised was in my animation loop. I've got a couple of lines of jQuery that move some elements on the page around randomly, to give a floating effect. The original code was as follows:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
$("h1 span").not("#h1p3").everyTime(0, function(){
    $(this).animate({
        'margin-left':rand_no(),
        'margin-top':rand_no()
    });
});
{% endhighlight %}

It turns out the problem with this code is that the animation was looping before it had completed, so the browser presumably is stacking up all of these $().animate(); functions, which in turn caused the browser to become unresponsive.

To remedy this, I specified a time for the $().animation(); function, and set the `$().everyTime();` timeout to slightly longer than this:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
$("h1 span").not("#h1p3").everyTime(500, function(){
    $(this).animate({
        'margin-left':rand_no(),
        'margin-top':rand_no()
    },490);
});
{% endhighlight %}

With these small changes in place, it seems my problem is solved!

I don't have any "lessons learned" speech to close the post with, it's just something that I found interesting :)
