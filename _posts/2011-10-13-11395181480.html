<p>I decided to take the plunge and upgrade my hackintosh to Lion 10.7 along with the other Macs in the house. After reading over the tutorial provided at <a title="Tonymacx86 Lion 10.7 Upgrade Tutorial" href="http://tonymacx86.blogspot.com/2011/07/xmove-multibeast-install-os-x-107-lion.html" target="_blank">tonymacx86</a> I had assumed it shouldn’t be more painful than upgrades I’ve done in the past. As per usual, I ensured I had a time machine backup and a clone disk of my current Snow Leopard installation using Carbon Copy Cloner. It was upgrade time, or so i thought.</p>
