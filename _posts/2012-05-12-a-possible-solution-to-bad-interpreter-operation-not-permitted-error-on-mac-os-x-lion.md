Out of the blue I started having an issue in my Terminal.app on Lion where downloaded scripts/applications wouldn't run. I first noticed this when trying to setup the Android SDK.

The problem looks like this:

`-bash: ./android: /bin/sh: bad interpreter: Operation not permitted`

After a bit of Google-fu, and a bunch of Apple Support Community threads that ended in people arguing about whether or not TextEdit caused this issue, I found a cause and a solution.

It turns out that for some reason, on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 apple is storing a `com.apple.quarantine` metadata file, which prevents executable files from being executed. Why is it doing this? Probably because the executable file was downloaded from the internet? who knows? 

Anyway, there is a solution:

`xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine [directory containing the executables]`

So, for me with the Android SDK, I ran the following:

`xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /android-sdk/`

This command deletes the `com.apple.quarantine` metadata files, allowing you to execute the executables.
