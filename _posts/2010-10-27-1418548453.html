<h3>So, you want to install Snow Leopard?</h3>

<p>So, after a few months in the making (or the not-making to be honest), i decided to polish and finish up my Snow Leopard Install Guide, this time, empowered by the awesomeness of boot cds and post install packages, custom made to get most of the features working quite easily, this is meant to be a quick setup guide, a lot of stuff can be changed/fixed later that is CPU Specific, which you’re on your own to figure out as it will not be covered by any means here.</p>

<p>This will get you from an empty HD, to a full 10.6.4 installation with little effort, you have to follow the instructions very carefully, specially when installing the Post Install package, as you need to select the appropriate DSDT for your system, everything will be detailed and explained, so you shouldn’t have any major issues.</p>
