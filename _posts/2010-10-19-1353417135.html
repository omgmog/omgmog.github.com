<p>I&#8217;ve been minecrafting a lot, my days have consisted of the following regime:</p>

<p>7:30 wake up<br/>8:00 leave for work<br/>6:15 get home from work<br/>6:16 start up minecraft<br/>&#8230;<br/>&#8230;<br/>1:00 go to sleep</p>

<p>Today would have been no different, except I&#8217;ve had to be productive this evening. Anyway, productivity as it is, procrastination rearing its ugly head I decided to try out some new plugins on my minecraft server..</p>

<p>The server is already running <a href="http://hey0.net/get.php?dl=serverbeta&amp;list" target="_blank">Hey0&#8217;s amazing server GUI/wrapper</a>, which adds plugin functionality and a whole host of other awesomeness (such as kits and spawns)</p>

<p>This plugin I was using (<a href="http://github.com/sk89q/worldedit/wiki/_pages" target="_blank">WorldEdit</a>) allows you to edit areas of the map en masse &#8212; so after generating a bunch of huge glass spheres, making floating biodomes containing water, and even making underwater glass biodomes containing trees, I got bored and decided to mess with TNT. </p>

<p>Now, by default TNT mass spawning is (quite rightfully) disabled with this plugin &#8212; but I figured out where to enable it, and so went about creating a region that was 20 blocks wide, 200 blocks long, and 3 blocks deep, filled with TNT..</p>

<p>&#8230;and then I set it all off:</p>

<p>It took 10 minutes for Mac OS X to recover from this &#8212; which was ample time for me to make a cafetiere of cinnamon coffee. </p>
