    HeyYour tutorial seems very clear , and it's one of the few about HP Chromebook 11, so thanks for sharing :)Before trying it, can i ask you which version of the Linux kernel is it booting ?

    In fact, i've just tested it, and seen it is Linux kernel 3.4. What would it take to make it able to boot at least kernel 3.9 ?

    You would probably need to cross compile your own 3.9 kernel. My method simply uses the kernel package distributed by http://archlinuxarm.org/

Just to follow up from my earlier post about [Installing Arch Linux on the HP Chromebook 11](/post/installing-arch-linux-arm-on-the-hp-chromebook-11/), I've put together a video of the process to show how simple it really is.
