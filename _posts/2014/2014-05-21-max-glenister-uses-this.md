### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Max Glenister, a front-end developer, tinkerer and retro-game fanatic. I spend my days working as the UX Front-end developer at [Aris](http://www.aristx.com), and my evenings flittering between moonlighting as half of [Marmalade & Jam](http://www.marmaladeandjam.co.uk), or playing with the newest toy/gadget that I've got my hands on.

Lately I've been getting in to [organising](/post/sushack-1-building-the-foundations-of-the-oxford-flood-network-stack/) [hackdays](http://sushack.co.uk), [building an arcade table in to a coffee table](http://imgur.com/a/Zf3BC) (still WIP!) and [installing Arch Linux on the HP Chromebook 11](/post/installing-arch-linux-arm-on-the-hp-chromebook-11/).

### What hardware do you use?

For computers, currently I'm constantly moving between the following:

- 2015 13" Retina MacBook Pro (Previously a 2011 15" MBP with [upgraded RAM and SSD](/post/upgrading-my-macbook-pro/))
- Late 2013 27" iMac
- HP Chromebook 11 ([running Arch Linux](/post/video-installing-arch-linux-arm-on-the-hp-chromebook-11/))

The MacBook is my main machine at home, and the iMac is my main machine at work. The Chromebook is a great size, but lacks the power (as it's ARM-based), but runs Arch Linux just fine and so makes a good home away from home.

For my phone, I'm using a [Nexus 5](https://store.google.com/product/nexus_5_black_16gb?playredirect=true), for my tablet a [2012 Nexus 7](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_16gb).

<s>I write in a number of Moleskine notebooks, and mostly use Paper Mate Flair fibre-tip pens.</s>

I'm now using a [dotted A5 Leuchturm 1917](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002TSIMW4?tag=blomg-21), [Pigma Micron pens](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000XAORIS?tag=blomg-21) and some nice grey ShinHan art markers.

I'm writing notes using the [Bullet Journalling](http://bulletjournal.com) method.

### And what software?

For *real* work, Mac OS with the following:

- **Editor**: [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)
- **Git**: [Sourcetree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- **Utility**: [Hush](http://coffitivity.com/hush/), [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/)
- **Email**: Google Inbox, Mail.app
- **Terminal**: [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home), [zshell/ohmyzsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- **Screenshot**: [Slingshot](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/slingshot/id436819784?mt=12)
- **Browser**: [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) mostly, but also [all the Firefoxes](https://github.com/omgmog/install-all-firefox).

Besides these things, I use a lot of things in the terminal. You can see what I find cool by checking out my stars on GitHub: [https://github.com/stars/omgmog](https://github.com/stars/omgmog).

### What would be your dream setup?

The dream would be having Sublime Text available on ARM. I would *kill* for that. I'm quite happy with my Mac setup as it is, I'm dreading whatever the future of Mac OS holds as iOS and Mac OS move closer together.

The only hardware feature I'd ask for would be more battery life. I'm constantly surrounded by charging cables, in my office, in my living room, in my bedroom. It's madness, and only slightly improved by 3/5 of my devices using the same standard charger.
