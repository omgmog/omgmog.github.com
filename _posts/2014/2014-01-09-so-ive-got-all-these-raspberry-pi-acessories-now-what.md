I wrote [back in May](/post/so-ive-got-a-raspberry-pi-now-what/) about having a Raspberry Pi, and very few ideas about what to do with it. Here's an update on the subject.

KickStarter is a great thing. People with great product ideas can find people who would be interested in their products, and those people back the products to help them reach their funding goal.

I've backed a couple of Raspberry Pi related things on KickStarter as of today:

- [Sweetbox II, the perfect case for your Raspberry Pi](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/677951563/sweetbox-ii-the-perfect-case-for-your-raspberry-pi)
- [Mini-ITX Motherboard for the Raspberry Pi - Fairywren](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kwang/mini-itx-motherboard-for-the-raspberry-pi-fairywre)
- [Kano: A computer anyone can make](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexklein/kano-a-computer-anyone-can-make)

Besides using KickStarter, others are independently creating products that compliment the Raspberry Pi, a couple that I've come across and purchased are:

- [Pibow Raspberry Pi case](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-raspberry-pi-case)
- [PiGlow](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/piglow)

In November I organised a [sustainability-themed hack day](/post/sushack-1-building-the-foundations-of-the-oxford-flood-network-stack/) where we used the Raspberry Pi paired with some custom-made sensors over white-spectrum radiowaves to monitor flood water levels and push the sensor data to the internet.

I've got plans to do some basic hardware stuff with the Raspberry Pi in the coming weeks, such as powering a couple of motors independently using the GPIO pins on the Pi. I'm sure I'll follow that up on here when it's done. You can see the hardware I'm planning to use [here on Deal Extreme](http://dx.com/p/lmr-mr-basic-educational-electronic-robotics-kit-3-aa-45542).
