If you were familiar with [Dingoonity](https://boards.dingoonity.org), you might have noticed by now that I've made the decision to shut down the website.

<!-- more -->

I founded Dingoonity back in 2009 as a place for portable gaming enthusiasts to connect and share their passion for the Dingoo A320 and other niche Chinese handheld consoles. Over the years, we grew into a thriving community with members from all over the world. It's been an honor to be a part of that community and to see the incredible things that the community has accomplished.

Over the years, we've had some amazing discussions, debates, and collaborations on the forums. From firmware hacks to game mods, we've explored the full extent of what these handheld devices are capable of. The Dingoonity forums were the go-to place for anyone interested in the world of niche portable gaming, and it's been a privilege to be a part of that.

The forums had a great run and served their purpose for many years, but it's time to move on. Technology and the way we communicate online has changed a lot since Dingoonity was founded, and the forums just don't seem to have the same level of engagement that they used to.

So, as with all good things, there comes a time when we have to say goodbye. It's the end of an era, but it's also the beginning of a new one. I'm excited to see what the future holds for handheld gaming and for the online communities that support it.

For now, Dingoonity will live on as an archive on Archive.org. Any `boards.dingoonity.org` URLs should redirect to a fairly recent (January 2023) archive of the page.
