title: LED Lighting and a Kill Switch

For the first (and definitely not the last) modification to my printer, I've added some LED lights. I've used a cheap strip of USB-powered RGB LEDs, and they're held in place around the top of the frame with their adhesive backing and some zip ties (for extra support!)<!-- more -->

Currently they're powered by an external USB plug, but I could probably hook them up to something on the printer or PSU. I might look at that in the future...

I also hooked up a rather dramatic looking _kill switch_ to be able to quickly turn off the printer when something goes wrong. It's sort of bodged together at the moment, I should probably print an enclosure for that...
