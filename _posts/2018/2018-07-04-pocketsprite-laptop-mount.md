I've been playing with this Pocket Sprite a bit lately. It's a tiny ESP32-based device that can emulate Gameboy, NES and various other classic game systems. <!-- more -->

Besides this, it's also quite straight-forward to develop for. The development process is a bit tiresome however, involving a multi-step process to get your applications on to the device.

To make this a bit less painful, and to distract me from my shortcomings in writing `C`, I decided to design a bracket to hold the Pocket Sprite in view while I'm developing for it.

The design isn't perfect yet (even <s>5</s> 6 iterations in!) but it sort of does the job. You can grab the .stl on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3001310) if you like too!
