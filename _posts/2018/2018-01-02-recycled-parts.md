I spent some time around new year 3D printing Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) characters for a friend. His main character is an Elven archer or something. We went to looking online for models that fit the bill. There are lots of free [DnD miniature](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?sort=relevant&q=dnd+miniature&type=things) models on Thingiverse to download and print.<!-- more -->

I didn't get any pictures of the final model we went with, it looked great though... I think it was a model from [this selection](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1372824). In the end it turned out it was the wrong scale (28mm when he needed 22mm or something?, I'm not sure.. I don't play DnD!)

Left over from that I had a couple of sets of legs, and some other bits and pieces. I decided to glue a pair of legs to a Cherry MX key. And well, that's the real reason for this write-up.
