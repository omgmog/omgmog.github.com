Well it's a bunch of buttons. This is a macro keyboard, by some description.

I had a bunch of arcade buttons kicking around from previous hobbies, and thought it would be nice to put them to some use.<!-- more -->

I designed a simple hollow box in Tinkercad, with holes big enough to receive the arcade buttons.

Unfortunately these buttons are very tall, so the final build turned out larger and less usable that I had hoped.

I also need to get hold of some smaller micro controller boards. I've got a couple of types of Arduino and an Espruino Pico kicking around, but I don't think any of these can do HID emulation (to _be_ a keyboard over USB) suitably well.
