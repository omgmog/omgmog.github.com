title: My face and words in print
---

Recently I was contacted to provide a short quote about why CSS preprocessors are awesome. This wasn't a hard task as I spend a lot of time evangelising the use of preprocessors, specifically Sass.

<!-- more -->

> Preprocessors save you so much time when going from an idea to an implementation, by reducing the amount of code you have to write, and providing some much-needed data-structures and logic to CSS.

I'm not saying a lot there, but given a 30-word restriction, and trying to focus on just one aspect of why CSS preprocessors are awesome, I think I did pretty well.

Anyway, this quote was to be included alongside a "Power up CSS preprocessor" feature written by Richard Wentk that appeared in [issue 236](https://www.imagineshop.co.uk/index.php/catalog/product/view/id/3614/s/web-designer-issue-236/) of Web Designer Magazine.

I haven't bought a magazine in a long time, but to have my words printed is a pretty nice thing, so naturally I bought a physical (and even digital) copy of Web Designer Magazine the moment this issue was published.

Imagine my surprise when I found that my face covers 1/3 of a page at the start of the feature.

The feature is nice, and does cover a lot of the pros/cons and features of various types of CSS preprocessor.
