Bit of idea ping-pong with <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.tmayr.com">Tomas</a> this evening, to provide a solution to something he is working on. He had some text in a table cell that needed to be split and put into an array, separating each line into two parts.

This is the snippet we came up with, to build a flat array

<pre><code data-language="javascript">$(function() {
    var array = $("p.src").html()
        .split(/([0-9]{1})\s([A-Za-z\s]+\s*[0-9°º]*)/);
    var position = 0;
    
    while (position != -1) {
        array.splice(position, 1);
        position = array.indexOf('&lt;br>');
    }
    
    $.each(array, function(index, value) {
        $("#array").append(index + " => " + value + "&lt;br />");
    });
});</code></pre>

Nice concise bit of Javascript, after iterating through a bunch of (over-complicated array rebuilding on my part) versions.. :D
