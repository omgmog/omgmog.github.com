title: "These tabs they are a changin'"

The latest update to Chrome (25.0.1364.99) seems to have brought some slight tweaks the interface. 

The tab bar has seen some tweaks to the spacing of the close button, as well as the hover/active/inactive states of tabs, and the infamous blank 'new tab' button has been stretched a little. The inactive state of tabs and the 'new tab' button seems to blend in to the background a bit more too.

The omnibar has lost a couple of pixels of weight, and over-all the whole interface is a lot more flat/smooth now.

Very subtle changes, but very effective.

Being able to confirm this on my Mac when I got home, and having the foresight to take a before and after screenshot has re-assured me that I'm not imagining things. Nice work Google Chrome team!
