<p>Another Chrome userscript for reddit.com</p>

<p>This one is specifically for anybody wanting to know if Notch (the creator of Minecraft) has responded to the comment thread they are reading.</p>

<p>This script <span>adds a div to the top of the comments thread saying if Notch has replied, and then has a link to each comment.</span></p>

<p>Grab it here: <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/110751" target="_blank">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/110751</a></p>
