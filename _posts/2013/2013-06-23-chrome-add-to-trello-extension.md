I attended the third [Refresh Oxford](http://www.refreshoxford.co.uk/) hack day yesterday, hosted at [Incuna](http://www.incuna.com/en/)'s offices in Summertown.

People came along with their own [project ideas](https://github.com/refreshoxford/hackday-3), and grouped off to do them, I came along with my idea of creating a Google Chrome extension that lets you add the currently viewed page to a board on Trello.

I was the only front-end developer there, amongst a mixture of Djangonauts and some dust-covered PHP aficionados.

I ended up taking my project solo, and so I produced my first extension from scratch.

You can get the extension over at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/omgmog/chrome-add-link-to-trello). If you find any issues, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/omgmog/chrome-add-link-to-trello/pulls) or an [issue](https://github.com/omgmog/chrome-add-link-to-trello/issues) and let me know.
