so, college started, as i've said already - it has been good so far, we haven't really started much or any work, so i guess my opinion on the college is biased at the moment, because of that.

in the last week, we've had some timetable changes - for good? for worse? well, we made some requests, like longer lunch, shorter break, and they were fulfilled, so i'm happy about that, and thursdays, today, i start at 1:30pm, and finish by 5pm - which in my opinion is a good thing.

no college tommorow, i guess i can work on the current xhtml/css things im working on - need to learn some more PHP so i can help [phill](http://hif.moglenstar.net) with his site a little..
