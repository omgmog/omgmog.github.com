[Microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com) got a redesign the other day..

glad to see theyre losing some of their tables in the new design.. glad to see that theyre incorporating CSS more.. it's a shame that a blind monkey could write better valid webcode than them though.

i can't write much about this without sounding too much like [Doug](http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2004/08/25/microsoft-advances.html) from Stopdesign.com - so you may aswell go and read what he has to say.. its interesting, statistically.
