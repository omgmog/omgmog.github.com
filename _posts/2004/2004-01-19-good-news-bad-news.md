wow, today has been fun.. well, kinda...

my PC hardware arrived for my new PC..

- amd2200+ cpu
- 512mb ram
- asus asrock motherboard
- dvd drive
- q-tec case (black with a side window, and a whole collection of LED's to play with :D)

so, it all arrived, and i put it together.. sucker took an hour and a half to put together, and if it works.. i will be happy. see, i can't actually use it yet.. as i said, it all arrived.. but one thing didn't.. the heatsinc and cooler for my cpu.. so, unless i want to, in the simplest explanation, kill my cpu.. well, i cant use it yet :(

kinda sad really :(

i've waited three weeks longer than i should have for my order, it arrives.. i get all excited, build it, its nice and stuff.. and i can't use it :\|

**site update:**

last night, as i said i would, i added the "about me" page.. i have still yet to finish the portfolio portion of my site.. i planned on  releasing it tomorrow.. but i can't see myself having it done.. i havent touched the code for a few days.

i noticed a bug in the php for this portion of the site.. whenever i post an entry, it reads the time from the server... this is a problem, because the server is located in canada.. i think (6 hours minus my time zone) and i'm located in england.. so this entry time may say "17:30" but, infact its more like "23:30" my time..

.. if i decide not to finish the portfolio tomorrow, then i will work on the code for the time on this.

**school**

good news.. i got a B on one of my math exams..  meh, it'll do for me :)
