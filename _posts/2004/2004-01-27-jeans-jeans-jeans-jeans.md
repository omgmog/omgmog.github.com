okey, change of plan yesterday...

... my nephews were brought around my house too late, so i couldn't take morgan to town :(

instead, we watched finding nemo.. fun.

(you try watching it 5 times and still liking it..)

so, today i had my math exam..

i think it went well, was easier than i thought it would be, there was only one question that i had a slight problem with.. i answered half of it, and was then stumped.. so i should get 1 of the 2 points for that question..

.. but it went by pretty smoothly.

they give you, say, 1hour 15mins .. and the exam, without rushing, took me 25mins .. hmm

90% of the people in the room were sat twiddling their thumbs for half of the exam.

i actually went to town today, with my good friend spok (aka steven... ..)

i bought some jeans :D

a rage against the machine cd.. (renegades.. to be exact)

and, looked around town for a while... ;)
