All the Whos down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot,
but the Grinch, who lived just north of Whoville, did not.

The Grinch hated Christmas - the whole Christmas season.
Oh, please don't ask why, no one quite knows the reason.

It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
Or maybe his head wasn't screwed on just right.

But I think that the best reason of all
may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
