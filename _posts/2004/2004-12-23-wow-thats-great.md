the only problem i find with providing the ability to comment on posts, on my site, is that

- "online poker" spam gets posted all over the comments
- fucking idiots spam and abuse the comments

i've deleted said comments, and now comment moderation is on, so if youre comment doesnt show, its waiting for me to check and allow it to be posted
