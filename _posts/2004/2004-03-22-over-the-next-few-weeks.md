... i intend to get the site going properly, that means finishing the design and pages …

– i'll have to talk to phill about him writing some content – i got to sort any downloads out, this being anything from modded system files to desktop icons and wallpapers (i have a few treats lined up) – i suppose i could talk scott into saying hi, and introducing himself.. perhaps…

the site is going to be a mess, and will have a nice facelift.. im hoping it wont go pear shaped like cher and her facelift, but you never know!

we'll see anyways, inbetween sleeping, eating, the occasional math or computing lesson, and some coursework.. i suppose i could get a lot done…
