the worst part to summer, is how boring it is.. yeah, ok most of the time the weather is great, and theres always someone willing to go on a bike ride, or what have you, but otherwise, i find myself sat at home, doing .. well, doing really nothing.

oh, its all good in the fact that i have time to do things such as my site, or some pixel art, stuff that interests me.. but i find myself in a timezone-less state.

I didn't sleep last night, i slept today 1pm - 7pm, and its only then, in my absence of time, that i realised how out of sync i am.

i'm gonna need to get back into GMT +0 pretty damn soon.. intime for college on september 6th.
