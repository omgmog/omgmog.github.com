.. fitted it, that was easy enough, plugged everything in, turned on the pc and then...

a BIOS stop code error.. could be one of two things.. bad GFX card.. or bad RAM.

well, i managed to rule the first thing (the GFX) out.. evidently it beeps even without the card in (although that could just be it bitching that there isnt a card)

and so, after reading the manual, decided it was the RAM.

apparently the chipset on my motherboard (chipset: SIS, mobo: ASUS ASRock) requires certain things from certain ram speeds..

as follows:
on the motherboard there are three DIMM slots..

- PC2100 (DDR266) 1 stick in each of the three DIMM slots, Max. 3GB
- PC2700 (DDR333) 1 stick in two of the three DIMM slots, Max. 2GB
- PC3200 (DDR400) 1 stick in one of the three DIMM slots, Max. 1GB

basically, if i read that right.. i need 3 sticks of this DDR266 .. not 2.. like i ordered. :\| you'd think they'd tell you this, eh?

bastids.

... sooo.. in an hour or so, i'm off to the hospital for my quarterly diabetes clinic.. yay! :\|

... but after that, me and dad are gonna go buy another stick of RAM.. so my new pc should be up and running tonight.. hopefully.
