i'm taking an IT course, right?
\- i am?
ok.. well, since when does IT consist of

- maths
- art
- design technology

<!-- more -->

\- well, i'm aware it does, in most aspects, but come on..
when does it involve practical design, actually designing something with a pencil and paper, then physically making it?
\- yeah, i wasn't too sure either.

so tommor- er.. later on today (jesus.. its 1am already) i finish college for this year, and with the thought of being festive, the lecturers decide to spring loads of work on me (not personally me.. the whole class too, infact)

i've got loads to do:

- design and implement an invoicing system, using delphi
- design an art gallery, or something, and then build it ..
- finish off assignments (ok so these are my own problem.. stupid **dead**lines.)

and i have a couple of webdesigns to do for people..
on that note, i finished louiemantia.com

that design took its time, part down to lou changing his idea on parts of his design mockup..
.. if i have the time, i need to implement wordpress tags into the design for him.. but currently, thats down to him.
(hey.. this is volunteer work.. the kind of "you-ask-me-and-i-might-agree-to-doing-it" volunteer work.)

i spent the other night sorting my mp3's ..
i regret having so much, and its any wonder how people can have and maintain more than 16gb of music.
.. i expect its my fault, for letting it get into such a mess.

on the though of mp3's .. *shudder*

my mp3 player has broken.
yeap, great piece of shit that zen xtra is
i was so proud of it too.. this is the perfect chance for my iPod-endowed friend to slap me in the face with a huge "I TOLD YOU SO!" sticker, and/or possibly a rubber chicken.

\- i'm not happy.
\- i want creative to get back to me, with a reply to my damn e-mail
