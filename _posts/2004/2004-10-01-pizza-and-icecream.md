it was my nephews birthday today, his name is Morgan, and hes 4.

it feels like only last week he was a baby, and was, as he would, cling to me whenever he was around - now hes all grown up, goes to nursery school, and aspires to being spider man in his free time - no thanks to the spider man suit he got today.

"i'm spider man, and you're my friend Hulk. we have to get the goblin" he'd say... good times.

we all went out for a meal for his birthday, this evening, it was fun and i'm stuffed.

it's amazing how much that kid can eat, half of a 9" pizza, a slice of birthday cake, and a huge bowl of ice cream covered in sweets, myself - i had a 12" stuffed-crust pizza, and couldnt even finish it, but still had room for some ice cream, and a few glasses of pepsi
