i was fortunate enough to get today off from college - it's not as if i missed anything..

i had a diabetes clinic check-up this afternoon, which was thankfully set during the hours i was meant to be in college today, 1:30pm - 5:00pm.

it's safe to say i couldn't have missed anthing, had i been there - it was a webdesign lesson, and frankly, its the only thing on the course im not enjoying yet - oh, it sounds odd i know, but for me, sitting through one of those classes, at the moment, is like sitting in on a first year english class, in a kids school.

I spent last night, from about 11pm, until 5am, messing with an idea for a new, yep, A NEW, website design- almost finished as it is, tonight, after working on it for the last 2 hours, 12am - 2am .. got some neat css tricks in it

when i choose to move it onto here, the main site, and not my locally hosted server, ( <3 apache, php5 ) it will hopefully be a really smooth process.

the hardest part will be recreating the pixel art page, or as it will be.. pages.

and adding new sections, such as "css ideas" where i will put online various css things i do/make, and also putting up a wider portfolio of the webdesigns i have made, am making, and make for people.

sounds like fun, eh.
