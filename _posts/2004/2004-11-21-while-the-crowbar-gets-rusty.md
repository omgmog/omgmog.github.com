i've been playing half-life 2 a lot this weekend, it's an amazing game, kudos goes out to valve for their amazing work on the game

<!-- more -->

i've played it for about 10 hours now, not at once, but over the last 2 days, and everytime i stop playing it, i HAVE to go back for more..

i've also been playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas a lot, and i've done about 40% of that so far, again, that's an amazing game

have hardly touched any webcode recently.. i dont know, i havent felt the urge to sit down with some caffiene and write xhtml/css.. call it a lack of inspiration; design wise, or a lack of motivation; effort wise.. i've had a whole lot on my mind, when not playing computer games, and thats the stacks of work from college.. its more than i had anticipated.
