well, its sunday night.. kinda pissed off that i lost an hours sleep last night.. (who's idea to put clocks an hour forward?)

this site doesnt seem to be doing anything at the moment, and equally i dont seem to be doing anything.

this weekend, i was Supposed to do maths coursework for my lesson tomorrow (2:20pm) – but its sunday night, i got as far as reading over the sheet, deciding it was stupid, working out some kind of thesis for what it was that it's about, and then writing the title in Word…

and even now, Word sits minimized on my desktop, i haven't even bothered to save the non-evident document…

I suppose this is what Phill considers procrastination – i mean, i know I have to do this work, and i try to tell myself i want to, but i just CAN'T

oh well, i have the whole morning free tomorrow, i suppose i can get a justifiable amount of it done then, in time for the lesson.. – heres hoping i'm not the only one who hasn't done it.. although, i know Scott hasn't done it yet either ;)

i would be a liar if i said i have done absolutely nothing.. but what i have done is far from useful.
