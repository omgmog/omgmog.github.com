.. i read an article the other day, amongst my web browsing..

the article was about how the author was so against "blogging" you know, and he even went as far as to describing the types of blog, and the mind behind the blogee...

.. it kind made me think, whats the point in having a blog.. a few people will read it, a few people will comment, but at the end of the day.. its a kind of self-voyeurism.. well, i may not get sexual gratification from reading my blog entries.. but i do read them, and as i type this, i type as if its to an audience.

i think i'm gonna discontinue a personal blog..

.. i'm working on a redesign (what's that? 3 weeks into your current design)

and i am yet to finish my portfolio.

aah, we will see.
