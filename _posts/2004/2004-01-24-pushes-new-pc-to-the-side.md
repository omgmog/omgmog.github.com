ok.. no entry for friday.. i was too:
pissed off
tired
pissed off
tired...

you get the idea?

i'm in an alright mood today.. taking to the blog now, as more of a blog.. you know.. i think i will leave the complaints about my new computer for another time/place/page.

after i write each entry to this blog of mine, i sit back, read over what i have just written .. and think
"fuck. how do i manage to write so much for this.. and yet struggle to write stuff up when i have to"

you know, it could just be because this site is more of a hobby than work, and you know.. now that i've got it, and its up and running (minus a portfolio.. uhmm.. shh) .. i actually have something to say to someone "yeah, i made this" ... rather smuggly, infact.

don't you just love these lazy saturdays?

well, not exactly lazy.. i attacked my room with a hoover today.. poor thing :( .. the hoover i mean, having to experience my bedroom...

surprised it still works, to be honest with you ;)

**listening to:- Red Hot Chili Peppers - Fortune Faded**

that song is great.

fin.
