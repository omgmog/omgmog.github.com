ok.. just finished getting the pixel art section, and about page up, thank God i had already been working on the pixel art page... it's not even complete, and i'm fed up with adding the rest of my pixel art to it.. oh well, all that isn't on there is some random pixel things, and some emoticon type things - i'm sure it'll survive without it :p

the about page is some hella creative writing.

just set up an [audioscrobbler](http://www.audioscrobbler.com) account, so we'll see how that goes.. [my user page](http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/moglenstar/) if you're at all interested in what im listening to..
