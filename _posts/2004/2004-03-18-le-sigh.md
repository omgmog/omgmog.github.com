i'm bored.. you wouldn't think i could be, considering i have my new pc and all, but i am…

played any and all games i installed (halo, q3, cs, dflw, etc..) and now i am at a loss for things to do…

work on the site is slow.. i have a lot of free time, but not enough time to sit down and work on the site.. although, today i added a new 404 page

hmm, i'll have to see what i can get done saturday, inbetween sleep and going to my sisters partay...
