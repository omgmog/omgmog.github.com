so i've been ill for the last week and a half, missed a bit of college last week because of it, unfortunately...

i haven't done much work with the new design, aside from re-writing the css so as to make the design more centered, it didnt look so good down the left hand side - i also re-worked the graphics, and the menu presentation.

i've decided to make a few changes to this design as it is, so if you're viewing this and it looks a bit odd, i'm either working on it, or i made something look completely stupid.

I ditched the "sperm" like header in favour for this.. green.. light.. thing. yeh.
