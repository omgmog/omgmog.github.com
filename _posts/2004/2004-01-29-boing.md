random entry subject.. meh.

yesterday i spent six hours out, yes out of my house... (oh my! max got away from the pc!) .. no, not quite, i was called upon to fix a family friends' pc... they were using Win98 :\|

successfully managed to sort out their problems (evidently it had a couple of viruses, loadsa spyware, and Word wouldn't run...)

now, they have Office 2000, AVG Antivirus, and Windows XP ;)

you know, it has been snowing here in oxford, it's been a while since it last snowed... i remember it snowing while i was at school, or at the weekends, resulting in a very slippery hike to school... never once did they close the  school. us kids, We were hard. heh, well, no.

im in 6th form (college) now.. at the same place as my secondary (high) school.

this week, its exam week, i have one exam, well.. had.. the maths on tuesday.

and now, i have a whole week off :)

.. you wouldn't believe... they've closed the school, because of the snow :\|

paranoia tells me that this is all a result of some personal grudge that the world has against me... but i'm not paranoid ;)

gonna send the motherboard from the new "pc" back today... i give/gave up on _trying_ to make it work... i can just sit and wait for "less than a week" for the new motherboard to arrive.. yes, thats "less than a week" their time. :\| (almost a month for 3 day delivery...)
