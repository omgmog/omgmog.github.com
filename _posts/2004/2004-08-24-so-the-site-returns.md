finally, after a long break, i decided to work on my site again, i've been working on the design for a few weeks on and off, and now im having to change it to fit around [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) .. not too much of a problem, its a nice engine to work with, and you dont have to go through any of that Site rebuilding crap, as with MovableType.

getting content on a website is a painful task.. well, i've pretty much done all of the pixel art, just need to get that up here now with this part of the site.

time to get something to eat, however, then i can really start to work!
