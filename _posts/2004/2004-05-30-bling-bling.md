damn, i'm broke at the moment.

spent £70 (incl. vat & postage) last monday on a new 120gb hard drive.. that was ok, as:

<!-- more -->

- a: i needed another hard drive
- b: mum lent me the cash

friday i got paid, not a lot.. as i didnt work much last month.. and already, i have spent the money, on more stuff for my pc.

currently the insides of my pc are in such a mess that i would be better of purchasing a grey pc tower, without a window, so as to hide the ugly mess.

i ordered some more lights, fans, rounded ide/fdd cables, cable tidies, and some stuff to clean the case - well needed investment!

so, tuesday it will arrive. I ordered friday night, first class recorded delivery.. but as its a bank holiday weekend, i wont get it until tuesday :(

oh well.
