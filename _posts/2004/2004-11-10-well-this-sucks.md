i'm finding myself with less and less time lately..
college, homework, work, it's all eating at my time.. if and when i do (any of) it.

<!-- more -->

i havent really had anytime to sit down and write some css/xhtml lately, either, which is annoying because i have a few projects i need to get underway, and im lacking any motivation to do so.

the usable standards group has hit rough waters at the moment, with hardly any of the team being around, hell, even the logo competition hasnt been judged yet.. although, i think i can work on that tonight.

i'm supposed to be putting together a website design for rich, and i have hardly even started on that.

i'm supposed to be making a whole site for my sister too, but also, thats having its own problems getting started too.

I have so many pixel pieces that i've started, and done a bit on, but havent finished..

without showing you what they look like:

- scene from Parabola by TOOL
- friends bedroom isometric
- other random things.

college monday through thursday, nothing fridays, nothing saturdays, and work sundays.. i suppose more than anything i need to motivate myself.
