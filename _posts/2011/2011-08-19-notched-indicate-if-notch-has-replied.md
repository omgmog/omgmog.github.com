Another Chrome userscript for reddit.com

This one is specifically for anybody wanting to know if Notch (the creator of Minecraft) has responded to the comment thread they are reading.

{% include posts/image-lost.html %}

This script adds a div to the top of the comments thread saying if Notch has replied, and then has a link to each comment.
