I created a userstyle for [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com) to make it look more like [Google+](http://plus.google.com) and other redesigned Google sites.

{% include posts/figure.html src="2011-07/reddit+ss-big.jpg" %}{:.center}

To install you will need either [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) or [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha) for Google Chrome.

I've only tested this in Google Chrome, and it's far from complete, but for now it functions nicely enough on subreddit pages and comment threads.

For the best experience, disable custom styles for subreddits.
