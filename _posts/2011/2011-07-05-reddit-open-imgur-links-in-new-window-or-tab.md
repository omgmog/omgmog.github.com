    How would you make this force Imgur links open in the same tab? I have open links in a new tab as my preference in Reddit., but I'd prefer to not do that with Imgur.

Derivative of the previous reddit/imgur userscript I wrote, this one simply makes all imgur links open in new window/tab (`target="_blank"`)
