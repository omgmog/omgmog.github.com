This is a userscript for Google Chrome (it might work with Firefox/Greasemonkey but I haven't tested). It binds the left/right keys to click on prev/next links.

This is especially useful for browsing comic archives, image galleries and blogs.

You can grab the userscript over at Github - <a href="https://github.com/omgmog/prev-next-arrow-binder" target="_blank">https://github.com/omgmog/prev-next-arrow-binder</a>
