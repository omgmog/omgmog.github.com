I rarely get excited about heavily stylised fonts, but for this I'll make an exception. Typogami is a multi-layer font -- so it's not exactly practical for every day use, but great for use in creating graphics/videos.

The font is made up of three "layers", these are "Frontside", "Shadow", and "Backside". Here's how you would use them.

In Photoshop you're going to want a layer of text for each layer of the font, here you can see the "Frontside" in red, "Shadow" in green and "Backside" in blue:

Here's how they look when stacked correctly:

And with some styling applied:

It's a really nice effect, and no doubt it looks good in a range of colours

This font isn't just limited to being used as a multi layer font in Photoshop either, there is an animated version for Adobe After Effects (CS3 and up) that has lovely animated folds and configurable shadows. You can see an example video over at Animography. You can get the fonts for free from the [Animography website](http://animography.net/products/typogami).
