I created this utorrent program icon from silk icons by Mark James.

Merging three silk icons together, and with a little pixel tweakage from myself - it works as a nice utorrent icon.

<div class="inline-grid">
{% include posts/figure.html src="moglenstar/icons/silkutorrent/silk_utorrent.png" %}
</div>
