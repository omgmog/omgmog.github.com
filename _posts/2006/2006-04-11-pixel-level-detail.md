It's probably by fault of my monitor, or the size that I'm attempting to do this, but when pixelling icons, it's hard to make distinguishable icons at less than 16x16 pixels.

Take the following smiley icons I made, for example..

<div class="inline-grid">
{% include posts/figure.html src="moglenstar/icons/nohue/smiley_smile.png" %} {% include posts/figure.html src="moglenstar/icons/nohue/smiley_sad.png" %} {% include posts/figure.html src="moglenstar/icons/nohue/smiley_grin.png" %} {% include posts/figure.html src="moglenstar/icons/nohue/smiley_wink.png" %} {% include posts/figure.html src="moglenstar/icons/nohue/smiley_shock.png" %} {% include posts/figure.html src="moglenstar/icons/nohue/smiley_tongue.png" %}
</div>

The "grinning" and "sad" smileys are almost indistinguishable.. Okay, so I'm using a small palette, but the pixel difference between the two of them is minor.

I think I need to go back to the drawing board.
