I've not been doing a lot with the site lately, mostly because i've been pre-occupied with other things..

Just had a holiday in spain, in the mountain village of Darrical - good stuff!

I've got various projects on the go at the moment, commision work, work for favours, just straight work.. and to top it off, i go back to college in a week!
