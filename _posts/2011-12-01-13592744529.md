I wrote a nice bash script that automatically downloads and installs the major versions of Firefox, sets up profiles for each and modifies the .app launchers so that they start with their designated profiles.

It's really useful for cross-browser testing, because of the differences between the different versions of Firefox.

Currently it installs:

- Firefox 2.0.0.20
- Firefox 3.0.19
- Firefox 3.6.25
- Firefox 4.0.1
- Firefox 5.0.1
- Firefox 6.0.1
- Firefox 7.0.1
- Firefox 8.0.1
- Firefox 9.0.1
- Firefox Aurora (nightly)

If you're interested you can grab the script over at Github -Â <a href="https://github.com/omgmog/install-all-firefox" target="_blank">https://github.com/omgmog/install-all-firefox</a>
