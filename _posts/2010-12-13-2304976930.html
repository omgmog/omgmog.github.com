title: A simple solution for a jQuery animation loop memory leak
---

<p>I&#8217;m probably stating something very obvious to everybody, but this is something that caused me a couple of hours of confusion.</p>

<p>When creating a new slightly-fancier page to be displayed on <a href="http://www.omgmog.net" target="_blank">omgmog.net</a>Â I had a problem in that after a certain amount of time the browser would become unresponsive (or in Google Chrome the page would die &#8212; but I love how Google Chrome handles this).</p>

<p>The problem I soon realised was in my animation loop. I&#8217;ve got a couple of lines of jQuery that move some elements on the page around randomly, to give a floating effect. The original code was as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="code">

<p>$("h1 span").not("#h1p3").everyTime(0,function(){

	$(this).animate({'margin-left':rand_no(),'margin-top':rand_no()});

});

</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It turns out the problem with this code is that the animation was looping before it had completed, so the browser presumably is stacking up all of these $().animate(); functions, which in turn caused the browser to become unresponsive.</p>

<p>To remedy this, I specified a time for the $().animation(); function, and set the $().everyTIme(); timeout to slightly longer than this:</p>

<blockquote class="code">

<p>$("h1 span").not("#h1p3").everyTime(<strong>500</strong>,function(){

	$(this).animate({'margin-left':rand_no(),'margin-top':rand_no()},<strong>490</strong>);

});

</p>

</blockquote>

<p>With these small changes in place, it seems my problem is solved!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; speech to close the post with, it&#8217;s just something that I found interesting :)</p>
