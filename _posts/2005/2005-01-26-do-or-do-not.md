So i've been working on the new redesign, not much, but i've been working on it.

using blogger to power the site now, i might chuck one of those neat "blogger powered" buttons on here somwhere, soon enough, perhaps on the about page, when i get around to re-writing it.

the pixel art page is about 40% complete, i've re-done all of the descriptions for each piece, but i am yet to torture myself by making thumbnails for each and every piece of pixel art.. regardless of how few there are, its still a tedious task.

i dont plan to enable commenting on my blog, on account of how much spam/crap posts i got before, when i was using wordpress, so if you read anything here, and you wish to talk to me about it, i'll put an e-mail link on the about page, when i get around to writing it.

that said, anyone watching this, expect some magic soon enough!
