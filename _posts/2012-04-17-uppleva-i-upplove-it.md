IKEA just announced a first-world-solution to a [first-world-problem](http://first-world-problems.com/).

UPPLEVA is their new integrated TV/blu-ray/stereo/kitchen sink/furniture solution for the living room. This is what I'd like an Apple powered/branded TV to be like.

Amazingly designed, but having it all integrated might make repairs/replacements a bit troublesome. Hopefully it's modular enough that you could just upgrade the TV part, or swap out the cabinet when you want something different.

Slashgear has a [bit more information](http://www.slashgear.com/ikea-integrated-av-furniture-coming-this-fall-17223202/) on the UPPLEVA.

There's no mention of who IKEA have partnered with for the hardware, or what kind of software the TV is running, but I'd be really interested in finding out. 

I can't wait for this to be available in the UK -- though according to the description it probably won't be here until 2013 at the earliest.

Just one remote control.

Shut up and take my money!
