title: Extract the first image from a post in Jekyll

I decided that I want to show an image next to posts in my "article list" type pages in Jekyll.

It would be tedious to go through each post and add a piece of Yaml frontmatter to indicate a "post image" (even though I [had this at one point in the past](/post/adding-more-post-metadata-to-jekyll-with-yaml/)!), so how could I automate this?

<!-- more -->

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/tooth-pull.png" alt="" class="center">

All of my posts exist as Markdown in the codebase, but Jekyll parses this to HTML when generating the `{% raw %}{{ post }}{% endraw %}` object. This chunk of HTML can in turn be parsed/split to find the first occurance of an image, and grab it:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
{% assign images = post.content | split:"<img " %}
{% for image in images %}
  {% if image contains 'src=' %}
    {% assign imageMarkup = image | split:">" | first %}
    <img {{ imageMarkup }}>
    {% break %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Once the logic for extracting the first image is sorted out, you simply need to throw that in to a file (I'm using `_post_image.html`) and then include it where you would like the image to appear.
