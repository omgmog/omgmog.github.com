I always find it hard to find things to write about when I have a blog. It's not that I don't have anything to say, it's just I don't like writing.

I've been busy this past week, creating a new community for the Dingoo A320 portable game device. The community is called "Dingoonity" and is available at http://dingoonity.org

I've been constantly working on improving Dingoonity since it launched on Friday at 7pm, and so I've had little time to work on much else.

Dingoonity features a Simple Machines Forum powered BBS, and since today a SMF powered news page which I wrote using SMF's SSI.php functions.

Working on this project has been a great experience so far. The Dingoo community is very much alive and crunching out new homebrew releases for both the Dingoo official firmware, and the "Dingux" linux port for the Dingoo.

I will probably post some more Dingoonity-related posts later, aswell as updating my portfolio with the Dingoonity designs when I finish the tweaks.
