Throughout October [Ben](https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben) and I are working on a project called [Cardboctober](https://cardboctober.xyz). The challenge is hacking on something new every day using Google Cardboard.

This will most likely involve a lot of JavaScript and Three.js, but it could even include "offline" hacks such as modifications to Google Cardboard.

I've got a huge list of ideas -- well, I've got enough ideas to cover the first 10 or so days of October, but after that the quality is probably going to go down hill.

I'll try to blog in a short-medium form here for each of my hacks.

Check out the [Cardboctober website](https://cardboctober.xyz) each day to see the latest thing that has been made.
