title: "20 Minutes into the Future with Google Cardboard and JavaScript"
---

I gave this talk at [JS Oxford in November 2015](http://jsoxford.com/2015/Javascript-Story-Time/). The talk is about using JavaScript and various web APIs to create Google Cardboard experiences.

I wrote the slideshow framework from scratch for the talk, using [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked), [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and some custom JavaScript.

To accompany the talk I also created some demos, these can be viewed online on [jscard.xyz](https://jscard.xyz). These are best viewed in Chrome on an Android device, but should work alright in Chrome on Mac/Windows too.

You can view the source for the slides and demos [here on Github](https://github.com/omgmog/talk-jsoxford-20-minutes-into-the-future).

To present the demos live, using an actual device, I used the Chrome extension/Android application [Vysor](http://www.vysor.io/). This allows you to stream your phone's screen over USB (via ADB), and it works really well.

Besides thinking about how to create Google Cardboard experiences using JavaScript, I've also been collecting resources about the UI/UX of VR, which I've put together as a useful list.
