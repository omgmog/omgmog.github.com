I couldn't find any good single place that collates the various articles and videos that are out there, so I've put together a list on Github.

You can [find the UI/UX VR list here](https://github.com/omgmog/ui-ux-vr), and if you've got any additional resources to add to it, feel free to send a [pull request](https://github.com/omgmog/ui-ux-vr/pulls).
