I've got lots of gadgets. I love gadgets. I've got a drawer full of portable games, and have a number of other non-game gadgets (though they're mostly all able to play videogames!)

My most recent gadget purchase was a Kindle 3 Wifi edition.

I bought this device after three days of deliberation - quite a lengthy amount of time, given my usually impulsive habit of purchasing things.

Since it arrived I've tried numerous e-book formats on it, all with great results, tried out the "experimental" web browser, which works very well given the limitations of the e-ink screen, and even modded the Kindle to allow for custom sleep/screensaver images

Here are a couple of the screensaver images I've made:

If you've got a Kindle and you'd like to use these, first you will need to mod the Kindle firmware, using the installers found here - [http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004)

Over-all the Kindle is a great device. The screen is readable from any angle, and I find that many people have a hard time understanding that it's a screen. It's really nice.
