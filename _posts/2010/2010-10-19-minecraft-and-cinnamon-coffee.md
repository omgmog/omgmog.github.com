    I see you have eliminated the work element of the regime...

A typical weekday for me:

7:30 wake up

7:31 check email

7:32 shower, eat, leave the house

8:30 arrive at work

12:30 lunch

1:30 work some more

5:00 leave work

6:00 get home, eat

7:00 - 12:16 start up minecraft

...

...

1:00 go to sleep

Today would have been no different, except I've had to be productive this evening. Anyway, productivity as it is, procrastination rearing its ugly head I decided to try out some new plugins on my minecraft server..

The server is already running [Hey0's amazing server GUI/wrapper](http://hey0.net/get.php?dl=serverbeta&list), which adds plugin functionality and a whole host of other awesomeness (such as kits and spawns)

This plugin I was using ([WorldEdit](http://github.com/sk89q/worldedit/wiki/_pages)) allows you to edit areas of the map en masse - so after generating a bunch of huge glass spheres, making floating biodomes containing water, and even making underwater glass biodomes containing trees, I got bored and decided to mess with TNT.

Now, by default TNT mass spawning is (quite rightfully) disabled with this plugin - but I figured out where to enable it, and so went about creating a region that was 20 blocks wide, 200 blocks long, and 3 blocks deep, filled with TNT..

...and then I set it all off:

It took 10 minutes for Mac OS X to recover from this - which was ample time for me to make a cafetiere of cinnamon coffee.
