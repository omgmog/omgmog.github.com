Today my Pacman Moleskine arrived - I'm pretty excited, but I won't be using it until I fill my regular lined Moleskine.

I've been learning Objective-C along with [@tmayr](http://tmayr.tumblr.com), so far covering just basic things such as processing user input and displaying output, using Cocoa/Interface Builder.

Most recently we've been looking at filesystem things. I'll probably post some of the haphazard things I've put together here eventually.

Some pictures of the Pacman Moleskine...
