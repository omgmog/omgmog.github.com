I ordered a nice Wills & Kate royal engagement commemorative mug by Chris Shipton ([www.chrisshipton.com](http://www.chrisshipton.com)) from Zazzle. It arrived today.

The mug quality is really nice. Some unpacking shots will follow, just to keep Chris happy - I think I'm the first person to have one of these!
