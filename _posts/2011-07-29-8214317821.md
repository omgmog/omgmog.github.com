I know, it sure is a catchy name!

This is just a modification of my previous &#8220;Imgur to Filmot url changer&#8221; userscript for reddit.com

<!-- more -->

Again this is to facilitate getting around the filters at work, it removes `/r/pics` and `/r/funny` from their respective comment urls, so they don't get caught by the filters.

So for example

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/</a>

becomes

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/</a>

Simple stuff - <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/108575" target="_blank">get it here</a>
