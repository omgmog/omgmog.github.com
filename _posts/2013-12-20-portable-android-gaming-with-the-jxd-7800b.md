It has been a while since I've had a new portable console to play with (and I'm still waiting for my GCW to arrive!), so let's ease back in to this stuff with an Android-powered console from JinXang Digital (JXD): The JXD 7800B.

<!-- more -->

JXD have been on the Android-powered portables scene for a while now, starting with their [JXD 7100](http://jxd.hk/products.asp?id=604&selectclassid=009006) back in 2011, they're a bit nicer than most other Android devices out of China, and they even have built in hardware controls too! 

Since 2011 the Android portables from JXD have been improving to keep up with the rest of the Android devices on the market, and now the [JXD 7800B](http://www.jxd.hk/products.asp?id=639&selectclassid=009006) has a spec that's comparable to most modern tablets.

## Specification
- **CPU:** RockChip 3188, Quad Core, 1.6GHz (cortex A9 CPU, ARM mali400 mp4 GPU) 
- **Memory:** 2GB DDR3
- **Storage:** 8GB internal, microSD up to 32GB
- **Screen:** 7" IPS LCD, 1280x800
- **OS:** Android 4.2.2
- **Battery:** 5000mAh

So the specs look great, but the device, like the previous JXD Android devices, resembles the offspring of a Nexus 7 and a PSP.

## Unpacking the JXD 7800B
I received my JXD 7800B from [DinoDirect](http://www.dinodirect.com/s7800b-quad-core-7inch-ips-rk3188-2g-8-game-android-4-2-hdmi-3d-p42169462.html), it arrived very fast and came well packaged. 

DinoDirect even included a plug adapter to use the US plug provided with British outlets, and they threw in an iPhone screen protector as a gift.

Here are some unpacking photographs:

So how does the JXD 7800B compare to other devices? take a look:

#### Google Nexus 7 (2012 model)

#### Sony PSP 3000

#### Nintendo DSi

#### Dingoo A320

#### Banana

As you can see, it's quite a large device. The size and weight are as follows:

- Length: 245mm
- Width: 120.5mm
- Height: 16.5mm
- Weight: 500g

Unlike most Android devices, the JXD 7800B doesn't charge via micro-USB port, but instead has a dedicated DC jack. Not so bad, if you intend to use USB devices on your JXD 7800B via an OTG cable, but sort of annoying because it means that you've got *another* charging cable to pack if you plan on taking the JXD 7800B anywhere.

There are two front-facing speakers, they sound pretty good with the games I've played on the JXD 7800B.

The JXD 7800B features both front and rear-facing cameras (0.3MP and 2MP respectively). As you would expect they're not great, but nobody orders a portable console from China and expects the cameras to be good.

Out of the box, the JXD 7800B comes with a couple of bundled games. Judging by the start up of each game (messages from cracking teams) and the features available in some games (lots of in-game money available), I'd say these bundled games are not legitimately sourced, but I'm not complaining. They're a great showcase for how well the hardware controls can work in games.

The included 8GB of storage is one of the problems I have with this device, as it's partitioned so stupidly. 1GB of installable space is no good if you want to install a bunch of 3D titles from the Play store. You can move some applications to the other 7GB of space, or even to a microSD card though, so the limited space is a limited problem.

The hardware controls on the JXD 7800B do feel quite sturdy, and having a cross-shaped d-pad is very nice. The right analogue stick doesn't appear to be functional in most cases, but I think I read somewhere that newer firmware versions fix that. Generally the games I've played with the hardware controls have worked great. GTA 3 runs very nicely, and (though incorrectly mapped) uses the hardware controls very well.

Compared to some of the other non-premium Android tablets I've used in the past, the JXD 7800B is really nice. If you're in the market for a new portable console, I'd suggest looking at the JXD 7800B. There are plenty of great Android games available from the Play store, and emulators for lots of classic games.
