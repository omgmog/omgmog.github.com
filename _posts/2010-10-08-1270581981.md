I&#8217;ve got lots of gadgets. I love gadgets. I&#8217;ve got a drawer full of portable games, and have a number of other non-game gadgets (though they&#8217;re mostly all able to play videogames!)

My most recent gadget purchase was a Kindle 3 Wifi edition.

I bought this device after three days of deliberation - quite a lengthy amount of time, given my usually impulsive habit of purchasing things.

Since it arrived I&#8217;ve tried numerous e-book formats on it, all with great results, tried out the &#8220;experimental&#8221; web browser, which works very well given the limitations of the e-ink screen, and even modded the Kindle to allow for custom sleep/screensaver images

Here are a couple of the screensaver images I&#8217;ve made:

If you&#8217;ve got a Kindle and you&#8217;d like to use these, first you will need to mod the Kindle firmware, using the installers found here -Â <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004" target="_blank">http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004</a>

Over-all the Kindle is a great device. The screen is readable from any angle, and I find that many people have a hard time understanding that it&#8217;s a screen. It&#8217;s really nice.
