It's my Birthday, so I've been printing things for other people (as a way to justify printing stuff!)<!-- more -->

I printed a couple of Spiderman busts for a friend. The first failed after a screw came loose on the arms that hold the printer hot-end in place. Even with an arm loose it finished the last layers surprisingly well, if just a bit too far to one side.

The second attempt turned out quite nicely!

Here's the model on Thingiverse: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2410987](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2410987)
