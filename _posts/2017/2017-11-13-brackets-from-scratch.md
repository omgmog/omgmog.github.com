Having my printer tethered to my PC is less than ideal, it means the printer has to be quite close to the PC because of the length of the USB cable, so I've been exploring other options.

I've got a Windows-powered tablet (the [Chuwi Vi10 Plus](https://blog.omgmog.net/reviews/chuwi-vi10-plus-review/) that I reviewed back in 2016) that isn't doing very much these days, so I thought why not use that with the printer?<!-- more -->

The tablet is large enough that it fits between two of the main upright pillars of the printer, so I figured I could design some simple brackets that would attach to the printer frame and hold the tablet in place.

This was an iterative process, involving lots of modelling in Tinkercad, printing, and re-measuring.

I had to print two types of bracket once I had agreed on a design. One regular and one mirrored, and then a second pair of the same.

In the end it worked quite nicely. The brackets are held in place with friction from the weight of the tablet and the tightness of clipping in to two sides of the pillars. I added some T-nuts below the brackets to ensure they didn't suddenly slip if the printer vibrates too much during operation.

The Chuwi Tablet works alright but it's a bit slow at rendering the 3D model view in Cura.
