I'm enjoying printing some great models from Thingiverse.

This little elephant is an articulated _print-in-place_ model. It prints in one piece, and then the legs sort of snap to become moveable.<!-- more -->

I printed mine on a _raft_ to help with the wonky bed calibration that I've got, and at a smaller scale to print it faster. Due to the scale the elephants trunk snapped off when removing the raft.

The print is a lot smoother in real life than in the photos, with the individual layers almost imperceptible to touch.

Here's the model on Thingiverse: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:257911](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:257911)
