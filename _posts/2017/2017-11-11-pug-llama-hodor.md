I've been going a bit overboard with printing novelty models from Thingiverse lately.<!-- more -->

First up a simple/geometic pug. The simple details and angles come out nicely when 3D printed.

Second the alpaca. This is much like the elephant I printed recently in how it prints in place.

Lastly a Hodor door stopper. I printed this a bit too small for my doors, but it turned out nicely still.
