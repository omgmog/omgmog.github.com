Delta style 3D printers can be very fast and accurate, but to get that point you have to do a lot of calibration and "dialing in".

I've had a number of problems over the past week, starting with general inexperience, followed up with a failed calibration sensor.<!-- more -->

The calibration sensor should allow you to automatically "level" the printer to get a good first layer on your print, so that each subsequent layer turns out perfect.

As you can see from the photos I had some problems getting a 20x20x20 cube to print it's first layers smoothly, but beyond that it looked great.

While calibrating the faulty sensor first smashed in to the printer bed, which only made things worse, so eventually I asked Anycubic to send me a replacement.

Should be much smoother once that is sorted out.
