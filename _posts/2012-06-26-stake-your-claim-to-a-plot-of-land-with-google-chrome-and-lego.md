As part of [LEGO Australia's "Festival of play" campaign](http://www.legofestival.com.au/), Google have rolled out a new toy combining two things I love: LEGO and Google Chrome.

Utilising a soft-around-the-edges version of Google Maps and a Javascript/HTML-based block editor, you can find a vacant plot of land (there's plenty of it in Australia, where the map is based) and build something using basic LEGO blocks.

You can also see things that other people have built, and share your own creations.

Check it out over at the [Build with Chrome](http://www.buildwithchrome.com/) website.
