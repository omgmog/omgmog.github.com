title: Reddit imgur to filmot url changer
---

<p>Browsing Reddit while at work probably isn&#8217;t the best thing to do if trying to be productive, but sometimes it&#8217;s necessary to unwind periodically.</p>

<p>Inside our intranet at work imgur is blocked, so browsing Reddit isn&#8217;t as enjoyable as it could be.. until now!</p>

<p>I whipped up a simple userscript to change all imgur.com urls into filmot.com (an imgur mirror, that isn&#8217;t blocked) so I can now browse Reddit hassle-free!</p>

<p>You can grab the userscript from userscripts.org here -Â <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/104691" target="_blank"><a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/104691" target="_blank">http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/104691</a></a></p>
