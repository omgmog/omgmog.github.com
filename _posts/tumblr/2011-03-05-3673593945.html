title: Building JavaScript arrays from HTML using regular expressions
---

<p>Bit of idea ping-pong with <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.tmayr.com">Tomas</a> this evening, to provide a solution to something he is working on. He had some text in a table cell that needed to be split and put into an array, separating each line into two parts.</p>

<p>This is the snippet we came up with, to build a flat array</p>

<p>Nice concise bit of Javascript, after iterating through a bunch of (over-complicated array rebuilding on my part) versions.. :D</p>
