<p>The Smashing Book #2 is a book about web design and development from the folks over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com">smashingmagazine.com</a>. As the name implies, it&#8217;s their <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-2-eu.html">second Smashing Book</a>.</p>

<p>When the <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-eu.html">first Smashing Book</a> was released in 2009, I jumped to the chance of buying a copy. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Smashing Magazine, and figured Smashing Magazine in print form couldn&#8217;t be a bad thing (and it would be a nice book for reading on my bus commute to/from work each day).<!-- more --></p>

<p>The first book talked a lot about coding best practice, usability and optimisation but was riddled with issues, from layout/editing issues (the justified text was unbearable, and it had numerous mistakes), to issues with the binding and over-all quality. On their end of the release I believe Smashing Magazine also had production delays too.</p>

<p>The second book is cut from a different cloth in terms of production quality, and article subjects, this time talking more about the philosophies of graphical design, user experience, user behaviour and typography (amongst other topics).</p>

<p>The issues of the first book are now gone, with a lot more time gone into editing/layout, and now contained in hard backing, the book feels like it&#8217;s a lot higher quality.</p>

<p>At the start of each section there are illustrations by <a target="_blank" href="http://yiyinglu.com/">Yiying Lu</a> (the creator of the Twitter &#8220;fail whale&#8221; illustration), which provide a good graphical representation of the subject of each section.</p>

<p>This book is less code-heavy than the first, but features a lot of good quality reading material. Page layouts seem a lot nicer and the articles contain colourful screenshots and representations of what is being discussed, which do a good job of breaking the pages up &#8212; though from time to time you will find yourself facing a wall of text, which makes it not ideal for commute-reading in chunks. </p>

<p>Overall I would say this is a much better book than the first Smashing Book. It&#8217;s a steal at the same price as the first, and a great resource for any web designer to have on their desk or book shelf.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next Smashing Book when/if it&#8217;s released and I hope that Smashing Magazine consider re-releasing their first Smashing Book as a hardback second edition.</p>
