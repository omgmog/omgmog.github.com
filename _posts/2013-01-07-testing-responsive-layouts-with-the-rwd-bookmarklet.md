Lately I've been doing some work with responsive CSS and media queries. This bookmarklet has been very useful. It allows you to switch between four different browser widths (for iPad and iPhone in portrait/landscape orientations).

<!-- more -->

To use it's quite simple:

- Drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar (or rightclick the bookmarklet and bookmark it)
- View the page you want to test your responsive break points on
- Click the bookmarklet, it will load the toolbar
- Switch between the different screen sizes using the toolbar

You can find the Responsive Design Bookmarklet at [Victor Coulon's website](http://responsive.victorcoulon.fr/)

I've made this in to a Chrome Extension, you can find it here: [RWD Extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rwd/geajggfcfhgkonghflklajfahmdnplmh)
