This is [a thing](https://nownownow.com). Here's a presumably recently updated page about things that are happening at this point in my life.

### Work

Working at Aris Technologies as _Lead UX & UI Front-end Developer_. I mostly spend my time implementing game UIs using web technologies.

### Projects

Here are some recent things I've been involved in. You can find more projects on my Github.

#### [Pocket CHIP Menu](https://github.com/omgmog/pocketchip-menu)
I've been working on writing a menu app for the Pocket CHIP using PyGame. There has been some work to revive the Pocket CHIP and get it running an up-to-date mainline Debian linux.

#### [Carbs calculator](https://carbs.omgmog.net)
This is a simple PWA that I wrote using Vue.js. It let's me pick a food from a list, enter the portion size, and then it gives me the total carbohydrates in the food.

#### [Airquotes The Podcast Airquotes](https://remotehack.space/live)
Since 2021 I've been editing the episodes for this short-form podcast that is recorded during each [Remote Hack](https://remotehack.space). You can find all episodes on Spotify.

#### [We're going to space](https://github.com/omgmog/were-going-to-space)
This was my entry for the 2017 Samsung VR Together Hackathon. It's a simple-ish Three.js WebVR scene that should work across most devices.

#### [UX of VR](https://www.uxofvr.com)
I created this list of VR UX resources back in 2016 and have been keeping it alive ever since.

#### Dingoonity

[Dingoonity](https://boards.dingoonity.org) is still going! It has been {{ site.time | date:"%Y" | times:1 | minus: 2009 }} years since it launched. My involvement is mostly janitorial these days. If you ever see a `500 error` page when visiting the site, it was my fault.

### Social media

I'm still [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/omgmog), though I'm not using it actively.

<figure class="iframe twitter"><a class="twitter-timeline" data-height="100%" data-chrome="nofooter noheader noborders" data-dnt="true" href="https://twitter.com/omgmog">Tweets by omgmog</a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure>

I'm on <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/omgmog#6206">Discord</a> occasionally. I've joined a handful of niche technology communities on there, but I don't participate much.

I have a Facebook account again, but it's used exclusively for contacting businesses that think only having a Facebook page is enough, buying things on Marketplace, oh and for my Oculus Quest account.
